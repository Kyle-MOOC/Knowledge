# Set

A set is a well-defined collection of objects which are called the elements of the set. A set is usually defined using a capital letter and the elements are contained in braces such as $A = \{0,1,2,3\}$.

## Axiom of Extension
A set is determined by its elements regardless of order, **i.e.**, $\{1,2,3\} = \{2,1,3\}$. 

## Elements
The object that make up a set is called its elements (or members). If $x$ is an element of A, then $$x \in A$$, otherwise $$x \not\in A$$

## Set Description
### Verbal Method
Sentence description. **e.g.** A collection of letters in the word 'mathematics'.

### Roster Method
Listing of elements in braces $\{ \}$. The elements inside a set is not repeated and the order of element is not important (axiom of extension). **e.g.** $S = \{m,a,t,h,e,i,c,s\}$

### Set-Builder Method
Combination of verbal and roster method.
- $S = \{x \mid \text{description}\}$ **e.g.** $S = \{x \mid x \text{ is a letter in the word 'mathematics'}\}$
- $S = \{x : p(x)\}$ **e.g.** $S = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: \lvert x \rvert = 2\}$
- Both $:$ and $\mid$ are interchangeable, and mean 'such that'. **e.g.** The set of real number such that the absolute value is $2$.
